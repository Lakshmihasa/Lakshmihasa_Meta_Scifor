It makes sure that incoming traffic (like users visiting your site) is evenly distributed across multiple servers. This helps to prevent any one server from getting overloaded, which keeps your website running smoothly and reliably. If one server is too busy, the load balancer sends new traffic to a less busy server, ensuring everything works efficiently."
