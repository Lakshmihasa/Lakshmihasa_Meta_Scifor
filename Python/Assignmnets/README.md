Use case of Oops

You have to make a Bank class which have two case executing 
1. Withdrawal 
2. Deposit 

And the Edge case will be ATM  Pin Verification 

In details 

Once your ATM pin will get verified then only you can withdrawal and it also shows withdrawal amount as well existing balance 

And same goes for second case, after verification of pin your deposition of amount take place it should show deposited amount and existing balance after deposit take place 

And if you encounter incorrect pin then your program should give the output invalid pin
